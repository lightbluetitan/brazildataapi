Description: Provides functions to access data from the 'BrasilAPI' and the 'REST Countries API',
    related to Brazil's postal codes, banks, holidays, company registrations, and international
    country indicators. Additionally, the package includes curated datasets related to Brazil,
    covering topics such as demographic data (males and females by state and year), river levels,
    environmental emission factors, film festivals, and yellow fever outbreak records. The package
    supports research and analysis focused on Brazil by integrating open APIs with high-quality
    datasets from multiple domains. For more details on the 'BrasilAPI', see <https://brasilapi.com.br/>,
