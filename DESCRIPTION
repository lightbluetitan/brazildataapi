Description: Provides functions to access data from the 'BrasilAPI', 'REST Countries API',
    'Nager.Date API', and 'World Bank API', related to Brazil's postal codes, banks, holidays,
    company registrations, international country indicators, public holidays information, and

    Brazil, covering topics such as demographic data (males and females by state and year),
    river levels, environmental emission factors, film festivals, and yellow fever outbreak
    records. The package supports research and analysis focused on Brazil by integrating open
    APIs with high-quality datasets from multiple domains. For more information on the APIs, see:
