# BrazilDataAPI

The `BrazilDataAPI` package provides a unified interface to access open data from the **BrasilAPI** and the **REST Countries API**, with a focus on *Brazil*. It allows users to easily retrieve up-to-date information on postal codes, banks, economic indicators, holidays, company registrations, and international country-level data relevant to *Brazil*.

In addition to API-access functions, the package includes a collection of curated datasets related to *Brazil*, covering diverse domains such as demographics (male and female population by state and year), river levels in *Manaus*, environmental emission factors in *SÃ£o Paulo*, Brazilian film festivals, and historical yellow fever outbreaks.

`BrazilDataAPI` is designed to support research, teaching, and data analysis focused on Brazil by integrating public RESTful APIs with high-quality, domain-specific datasets into a single, easy-to-use R package.
