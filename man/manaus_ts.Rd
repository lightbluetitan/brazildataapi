\description{
This dataset, manaus_ts, is a univariate time series of monthly average river heights of the Rio Negro at Manaus.
The series contains 1080 observations spanning 90 years, from January 1903 to December 1992. Each value represents
the monthly average of the daily stages (heights) of the Rio Negro. Manaus is located 18 km upstream from the confluence
of the Rio Negro with the Amazon River, and due to the minimal slope and flatland affluents, the measurements can be considered
a good approximation of the water level at the confluence.
